### Hello World ðŸ‘‹

Here's a glimpse into what I'm passionate about and my journey so far:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently engrossed in developing an AI-powered WhatsApp-based digital health chatbot for my Master's thesis. This project combines my interests in technology, health, and user-centric design.
- ðŸŒ± Continuously learning and evolving is my mantra. I delve into new technologies and methodologies to refine my skills.
- ðŸ‘¯ Open to collaborate on innovative projects, especially those that leverage technology to improve daily life.
- ðŸ¤” Seeking guidance and perspectives on emerging tech trends and best practices in AI and mobile application development.
- âš¡ Fun fact: Back in 2018, when roaming costs were sky-high, I developed an iOS application for my Matura project that allowed users to save places offline. It was an exciting challenge that blended my love for travel and technology.
